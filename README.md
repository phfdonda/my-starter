This is my own [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter.

## Modifications

_The difference from the original starter created using `npx create-next-app@latest` is that I changed the following:_

> 1. Added SASS for styling.
> 2. Created folders for the style sheets, components and hooks.
> 3. Changed the extensions of the files from `.js` to `.jsx`.
> 4. Added the baseUrl to the `jsconfig.json` file.
> 5. Added support for several file extensions in the `next.config.js`

## Choices

_I have chosen to create a simple `.js` starter, and just add a branch later with the Typescript version of it._

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
